# 🧩 LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to various [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems.  
Each solution is organized by topic and includes:
- **Source code** (Java, Python, or JavaScript depending on the problem).
- **Explanation README** with problem description, approach, and complexity analysis.
- **DSA Tutorials** from time to time, publishing various algorithms lectures

The goal of this repo is two-fold:
1. **Practice** — strengthen problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.  
2. **Portfolio** — showcase clean, well-documented solutions as a reference for interviews and projects.

## 🛠️ Languages Used
- **Java** — primary language for most solutions.  
- **Python** — for quick prototyping.  
- **JavaScript** — for frontend interview-style practice.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Build a solid **DSA reference** while preparing for interviews.  
- Track progress over time.  
- Share knowledge with other learners.

## 📌 Note
These are my personal solutions.  
Some problems may have multiple valid approaches — I focus on clarity and correctness first, then optimization.
